# Projetos

This repository contains two small programming projects targeting microcontrollers and assembly programming.

## Contents

- **Assembly** – An x86 assembly example that calculates and prints all odd numbers between 0 and a user-provided `N`. The file includes comments in Portuguese explaining each instruction step-by-step.
- **Portao Residencial.ld** – A ladder logic program for LDmicro intended for a PIC16F887 microcontroller. It demonstrates a simple residential gate controller with input buttons and timers.

## Usage

These files are provided as examples and may require specific tools:

1. `Assembly` can be assembled with an assembler such as MASM, TASM or NASM. Review the comments to understand the flow before assembling.
2. `Portao Residencial.ld` is designed for LDmicro. Open the file in LDmicro to simulate or compile it for the PIC16F887.

Feel free to study or adapt the code for your own microcontroller experiments.
